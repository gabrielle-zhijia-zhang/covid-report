## Project Summary
For this project, I utilized a COVID deaths dataset from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). I then constructed and ran queries against this dataset for number of COVID infections, deaths, and vaccinations globally. Finally, I built a dashboard in Tableau to showcase how the data varies across location and time.
